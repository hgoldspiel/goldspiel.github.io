Greetings! I'm a conservation biologist, data scientist, and outdoor enthusiast. 

I am currently a PhD Student at the [University of Maine](https://www.umaine.edu) in the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Conservation Biology with Dr. Noah Charney.

Welcome to my personal website for rambling on conservation research, wildlife, data science, and other miscellaneous musings.

When not tinkering in R, you might find me flipping logs in a forest somewhere.

My full CV is available [here](docs/Goldspiel_Harrison_CV_August2021.pdf).
